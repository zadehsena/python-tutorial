# Exercise description

# The next step on our journey to create Wordle is to produce a program that 
# gives the player one shot at guessing the secret word. In this exercise, 
# you will prompt the user for a word that 5 letters long. If the word is not
# 5 letters, you will ask them to input another 5 letter word. Otherwise, you
# output a series of green/yellow/white squares corresponding to the input.

# We will use "logan" for the purposes of our example and testing. 

# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Exmaple inputs and outputs

# What is your 5-letter guess? laggy
# ðŸŸ©ðŸŸ¨ðŸŸ©ðŸŸ¨â¬œ
# Not quite. Play again soon!

# What is your 5-letter guess? began
# â¬œâ¬œðŸŸ©ðŸŸ©ðŸŸ©
# Not quite. Play again soon!

# What is your 5-letter guess? congradulations
# That was not 5 letters! Try again: python
# That was not 5 letters! Try again: lager
# ðŸŸ©ðŸŸ¨ðŸŸ©â¬œâ¬œ
# Not quite. Play again soon!

# What is your 5-letter guess? logan
# ðŸŸ©ðŸŸ©ðŸŸ©ðŸŸ©ðŸŸ©
# Woo! You got it!
